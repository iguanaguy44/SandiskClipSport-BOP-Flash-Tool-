# SandiskClipSport-BOP-Flash-Tool-

My plan (with as much help as people are willing to give) is to build an app that can be accessible at Google play store. 

  üîπBuild a simple app with the proper drivers to access the ATJ2127 processor. 

  üîπFlash the SandiskClipSport with the US212A_DEMO.fw while in firmware flash mode.

  üîπRestart the SandiskClipSport. Then flash using the Upgrade.Hex

This tool will be based off the https://androidmtk.com/use-actions-pad-product-tool#google_vignette

I imagine it will be similar to this app that someone else made for android but is not so quick to share.

GOAL: Help everyone who paid $1.50 for each .mp3 and now only has access through the BOP tablet and only if you don't want a radio. Because not everyone wants to take their Tablet for a Jog.
